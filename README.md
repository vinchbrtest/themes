[Role Theme Demo](https://role-theme.zendesk.com/hc/en-us)

- Inspired by reoccurring requests by customers to organize their content around user roles
- Good for use cases where:
- usefulness of content to users is primarily based on their roles (so content for one role would be largely useless to a different role)
- good for other category types that tends to be limited and/or fixed (2-5 categories), like products or brands.
